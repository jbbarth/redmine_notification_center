# IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER ABOUT THIS HACK
#
# I am *not* proud of this one, but at least it doesn't break
# other plugins and redmine tests. Redmine's whole test suite
# is build around test/unit and shoulda, which is not something
# I like, but it's like that. If I just put my spec next to
# test/unit ones and require rspec/autorun, it just breaks a
# lot of shoulda keywords, hence break most of my plugins
# tests, so here we are...
#
# Please please please tell me if you have a better idea,
# I'd gladly offer a beer or two.
