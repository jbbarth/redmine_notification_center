Redmine Notification Center plugin
==================================

This plugin adds a "Notifications" tab to "My account" page. It allows you to control
which notifications are sent to you with fine-grained rules and exceptions.

Disclaimer
----------

This plugin totally **replaces** the default mailer in Redmine. Hence it has to be carefully validated for each Redmine version. The plugin voluntarily breaks on non-validated Redmine versions, it won't even boot in these cases. It cannot run under Redmine < 2.1.0 because it relies on the jQuery javascript framework.

For now, it has only been tested on Redmine 2.1.0.
